Run cells sequentially to reproduce results.

Tasks Overview:

Task 1: Classical ML using Decision Tree classifier on the Iris dataset.

Task 2: Deep Learning using a CNN on MNIST handwritten digits.

Task 3: NLP with spaCy for named entity recognition and sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews.

Ethics & Optimization: Discussion on potential biases and troubleshooting approaches.


Results:

Task 1: Accuracy, Precision, Recall = 1.0

Task 2: Test Accuracy = 96.49%

Task 3: Extracted entities and sentiment classification for sample Amazon reviews
